            experiments in plant
            breeding and variety testing based on linear mixed models</h2>
        <p class="authorship">Prof. Dr. Hans-Peter Piepho, University of Hohenheim</p>
        <p>This workshop will consider statistical issues arising in the design and analysis of experiments in plant
            breeding and
            variety testing, focusing on recent developments in the field. I will start by considering individual trials
            and then
            will move on to the integration of trials across multiple environments, where modelling of
            genotype-environment
            interaction is required.</p>
        <p>Topics covered for individual trials will include a model-free approach to generating efficient designs,
            two-phase
            experimental designs, the use of post-blocking in assessing the merits of alternative designs, recovery of
            inter-block
            information, and spatial analysis. In relation to multiple environment trials, I will consider, e.g., sparse
            testing,
            the optimal allocation of trials to agro-ecological zones, variance-covariance structures for modelling
            genotype-environment interaction, the use of environmental covariates to enhance predictions and
            recommendations,
            assessment of long-term trends and genetic gain, and two-stage versus single-stage analysis.</p>

        <!--         <p>In this masterclass we will explore some of the data mining and more advanced statistical modelling
            facilities available
            in Genstat. As not all these facilities are available in the menus, the session will begin with a brief
            recap of
            Genstatâ€™s command language.</p>
        <h3>Topic will include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Genstat command language,</li>
            <li>Data mining;

                    <li>GLMMs and HGLMs - how do they differ and what are their advantages/disadvantages?</li>
                    <li>new facilities for assessing fixed models in REML,</li>
                    <li>generating reports and exporting results (i.e. interoperability).</li>
