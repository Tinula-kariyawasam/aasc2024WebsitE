                    quantification of uncertainty in water resources analysis.
                    She has a special interest in understanding how
                    environmental observations can be used to quantify
                    uncertainty in systems undergoing change. Her research
                    has spanned the development of new models in the most
                    heavily instrumented watershed in the United States to
                    making flood predictions in ungauged catchments across
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>Lucy completed her BEng (Hons), MEngSc, and PhD at the
