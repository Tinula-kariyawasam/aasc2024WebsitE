                    Faculty of Science and Engineering. She is a water resources engineer, with expertise in hydrologic
                    modeling, environmental model optimization, and quantification of uncertainty in water resources
                    analysis. She has a special interest in understanding how environmental observations can be used to
                    quantify uncertainty in systems undergoing change. Her research has spanned the development of new
                    models in the most heavily instrumented watershed in the United States to making flood predictions
                    in ungauged catchments across Australia.</p>

                    University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany in 2001. He has been working as an applied statistician
                    in agricultural research for more than 30 years. His main interests are related to statistical
                    procedures as needed in plant genetics, plant breeding and cultivar testing. Recent interests
                    include envirotype- and marker-enabled breeding, spatial methods for field trials and experimental
                    design for various applications including two-phase experiments and multi-environment trials.
                    Further areas of interest include network meta-analysis and measure of goodness of fit for
                    generalized linear mixed models.</p>

                    for genotype-environment interaction, and network meta-analysis. Moreover, we have various
                    collaborations with researchers in different branches of the agricultural sciences. In most of our
                    research, mixed model procedures form the
